# Frequently Asked Questions

## 🤔 General Questions

### ❓ What is AgentK?
AgentK is a local AI automation platform that allows you to create and manage AI agents on your own hardware. It provides a web interface for interacting with local AI models and automating tasks.

### ❓ Is AgentK free to use?
Yes! AgentK is open-source and completely free to use. You only need to provide your own hardware and optionally pay for any external services you integrate.

### ❓ What are the system requirements?
**Minimum**:
- 8GB RAM
- 10GB storage
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+

**Recommended**:
- 16GB+ RAM
- 20GB+ storage
- Modern CPU (Intel i5+/Ryzen 5+)
- SSD storage

### ❓ Do I need an internet connection?
While AgentK runs locally, some features like web research capabilities require internet access. The core AI inference works completely offline if you're using local models.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### ❓ Installation fails with permission errors
**Solution**:
```bash
# Use sudo for system packages
sudo apt install python3-pip

# Or install in user space
pip install --user -r requirements.txt

❓ "Command not found" when running scripts

Solution:
bash

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/*.sh

# Run with bash explicitly
bash scripts/setup.sh

❓ Node.js version issues

Solution:
bash

# Use nvm to manage Node.js versions
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
nvm install 16
nvm use 16

AgentK supports:

    Any model running in LM Studio

    Any model running in Ollama

    Any OpenAI-compatible API endpoint

    Custom models with appropriate APIs

❓ How do I add new models?

    LM Studio: Load the model in LM Studio UI

    Ollama: ollama pull model-name

    Custom: Configure API endpoint in settings

❓ Why is my model not showing up?

    Check if model server is running

    Verify the API endpoint URL

    Ensure the model is properly loaded

    Check firewall/network settings

❓ How much RAM do models need?

    7B models: ~8GB RAM

    13B models: ~16GB RAM

    34B models: ~32GB RAM

    70B models: ~64GB RAM

💬 Usage & Features
❓ How do I create my first agent?

    Click "+ New Agent" in the top right

    Fill in name, description, and model

    Select capabilities

    Click "Save" and then "Test"

❓ What are capabilities?

Capabilities are special skills your agent can have:

    Web research

    Data analysis

    Code generation

    Content writing

    And many more...

❓ How do workflows work?

Workflows allow you to chain multiple agents and actions together. You can create automated pipelines for complex tasks using a visual editor.
❓ Can I use multiple models simultaneously?

Yes! You can have different agents using different models, and they can work together in workflows.
🔧 Technical Issues
❓ "Out of memory" errors

Solutions:

    Use smaller models

    Reduce context window size

    Close other applications

    Add more RAM to your system

❓ Slow response times

Solutions:

    Use faster models (better quantization)

    Reduce context window

    Enable response streaming

    Upgrade your hardware

❓ Database errors

Solutions:

    Restart the application

    Check disk space

    Run database repair: ./scripts/repair_db.sh

❓ WebSocket connection issues

Solutions:

    Check firewall settings

    Verify network connectivity

🛠️ Customization & Development
❓ How do I create custom plugins?

    Create a class extending BasePlugin

    Implement the execute method

    Register your plugin

    Add configuration if needed

❓ Can I modify the UI?

Yes! The frontend is built with vanilla JavaScript and is completely customizable. The code is in the frontend/ directory.
❓ How do I add new capabilities?

❓ Is there an API?

Yes! AgentK provides a comprehensive REST API. See the API Documentation for details.
📊 Performance & Optimization
❓ How can I improve performance?

    Use quantized models (Q4, Q5)

    Enable response streaming

    Use appropriate model sizes for your hardware

    Close unnecessary applications

❓ What's the best model for my use case?

    General chat: Mistral 7B, Llama2 7B

    Code generation: CodeLlama, StarCoder

    Creative writing: Llama2 70B, Mixtral

    Research: Mixtral, larger models

❓ How do I reduce memory usage?

    Use smaller models

    Reduce context window

    Disable memory-intensive capabilities

    Close other applications

🔒 Security & Privacy
❓ Is my data private?

Yes! AgentK runs entirely on your local machine. Your data never leaves your system unless you explicitly configure external integrations.
❓ How is data stored?

    Conversations: SQLite database

    Files: Local filesystem

    Vector storage: Local ChromaDB instance

    All data encrypted at rest

❓ Can I password-protect my installation?

Yes! You can enable authentication in the settings. This requires a password to access the web interface.
❓ Are there any security risks?

As with any local software, ensure you:

    Keep your system updated

    Use strong passwords if enabling auth

    Be cautious with custom plugins

    Regular backups

🌐 Networking & Remote Access
❓ Can I access AgentK remotely?

Yes, but be careful about security:
