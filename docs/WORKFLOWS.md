## 🔄 Understanding Workflows

Workflows are automated sequences of actions involving multiple agents and services. They enable complex multi-step processes and automation.

### Workflow Components
- **Nodes**: Individual processing steps
- **Connections**: Data flow between nodes
- **Triggers**: Workflow initiation points
- **Conditions**: Branching logic
- **Outputs**: Final results and side effects

## 🚀 Creating Your First Workflow

### Basic Research Workflow
```yaml
name: "Research Pipeline"
description: "Automated research and summarization"
nodes:
  - id: "start"
    type: "start"
    position: { x: 100, y: 100 }
  
  - id: "research"
    type: "agent"
    agent_id: "research-agent"
    position: { x: 300, y: 100 }
  
  - id: "summarize"
    type: "agent" 
    agent_id: "summarization-agent"
    position: { x: 500, y: 100 }
  
  - id: "end"
    type: "end"
    position: { x: 700, y: 100 }

connections:
  - from: "start", to: "research"
  - from: "research", to: "summarize" 
  - from: "summarize", to: "end"

    parent: "try-process"
    on_error: true

🔌 Integration Patterns
Webhook Triggers

triggers:
  - type: "webhook"
    path: "/webhook/research"
    method: "POST"
    validation:
      secret: "${WEBHOOK_SECRET}"

Scheduled Workflows

triggers:
  - type: "schedule"
    cron: "0 9 * * *"  # Daily at 9 AM
    timezone: "UTC"

File Watchers
yaml

triggers:
  - type: "file_watch"
